# Rock, Paper, Scissors - GAME ðŸŽ®

This is a challenge I found on Frontend Mentor, and I thought it would be fun to turn it into a Telegram mini-app so you can play as much as you want. 

It's the classic and popular game we all know â€”Rock, Paper, Scissors. Have fun! ðŸ˜‰ [Play here!](https://nullhq.github.io/rpsls)
